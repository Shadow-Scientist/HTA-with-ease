# Moving a HTA with ease!
Life goes on the ease. We can see easing everywhere. Have you ever heard about a HTA that can deliver notifications to you, with easing ?
So how about thinking a HTA as a notification box. Can't we make a HTML Application that can be used to deliver notifications ?

Here, notify.hta is the base hta, I mean the notification box, and dlg.hta is an another hta file that contains the message. If everything goes right, you will see a small box on the bottom-left corner of the screen, decelerating to zero velocity. Download and open the notify.hta and see it in action!
